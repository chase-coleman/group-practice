# Git Workshop Pt. 2 - Teamwork - Build the Pokedex

As a team, build a full-stack Django/React Pokedex app. The code is given to you; the focus is on workflow & communication.

Use this as a team to practice the "feature branch" workflow.

**You have a 30-minute timeline;** this forces speed and communication.

After that, **the class should reconvene,** share challenges/lessons learned, discuss, and review. 

## Instructions

1. One teammember **CLONES** this repo. That becomes the 'team repo.'
2. Make sure everyone on the team has read/write permissions to the 'team repo' - they should be able to make pull requests.
3. Each teammate [does *one* of the assignments](./your-assignments). Use the 'feature branch' workflow, and make PR's. You will need to communicate and coordinate.
4. You will need to figure out the ideal sequences for merging PR's.
5. Make sure after each PR is merged that `main` works! You should be able to pull it down and run it.
6. If there are more assignments than teammates, everyone should do one, and once they are all merged to main, do the remaining.
7. Make sure your program runs once everyone is done! Make sure everyone on the team has the final version of the code, and that it runs on their machine. 

The goal is to force communication and coordination/sequencing of 'what gets merged first.'

These assignments are more "finely sliced" than you would do in the real world to emphasize the need for communication, but provide a good general guideline of how wone can divide up work so teammates can get work done "in parallel."
